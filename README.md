# Ruiner's Fortress

My own personal TF2 mod, mostly readding old models, some reverts and planning to add new weapons.

## Credits

- **Conneath's** TF2 Gold Rush Code: adding support for v/w_models loading directly from items_game.txt and minigun brass effect.

- **Grub's** Grub Fortress Code: the implemetation of removing miscs and action slot was thanks to his work. Also his build.yml file.

- **TF Archived** Discord server: Sharing the files of old tf2.
